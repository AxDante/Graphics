# wave_sim

**Wave_sim** is a simple C++ program that help users visualize wave propagation in two-dimensional spaces. The waves are modeled as particles and their positions updated based on the inbuilt mass-spring model. Gravity, initial forces, interaction forces, and boundaries are all implemented in the program to simulate various kinds of disturbances. The interactive feature allows wave settings and scece objects to be added/adjusted during the simulation.
